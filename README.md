While Personal Medical Devices (PMDs), a category which includes implantable and wearable medical devices, have immediate and lasting positive effects on patient health, these devices can have unpredictable and detrimental effects on the privacy of the patients, their families, and any groups or organizations that the patient interacts with. 

PMDs range from established technologies such as insulin pumps and pacemakers, fitness trackers to biometric sensors. actuators for prosthetics, and cranial implants for Parkinson's disease. 

Despite the different purposes of these PMDs, all PMDs share qualities, such as attack vectors, physical designs, and operational models. The data collected by PMDs is used by a wide group of practitioners, device manufacturers, and insurance providers, often without the patient's awareness. This data contains highly sensitive patient health information. 

PMDs, because they are integrated into a patient's biology, they also present a unique challenge to security and privacy strategies, because unlike other personal devices, the patient cannot stop using an PMD when entering a building or before engaging in conversation. The use of PMDs also carries some stigma, so patients are reluctant to reveal their usage, and the devices can be difficult to detect, so they are frequently not accounted for in organizational planning. 

Therefore, PMDs present both a security risk, in that they are often ignored and unprotected, and also a privacy risk, in that the data they collect is widely shared with little or no involvement from the patient. To be fully effective, any personal or organizational security plan should also account for the growing presence of PMDs. 

My graduate thesis, [now available as a book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5N13WFH), reviews the current threats to personal and organizational security that are presented by personal medical devices and identifies key trends. One such trend is the growing adoption of multiple, integrated personal medical devices to increase the quality of life for diabetics.
